# Package to control baxter's left end effector position
BANXTER PROJECT - SOFAR - Robotics Engineering UNIGE
## Installation and requirements
- Ubuntu 16.04 x64 (https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/)
- Ros Kinetic (http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu)
- Gazebo 7.15 (included in full installation of ROS kinetic)
- Baxter Simulator (https://sdk.rethinkrobotics.com/wiki/Simulator_Installation, following the steps for Ros Kinetic)

## Configuration
Configure the IP of the local machine: open `~/catkin_ws/baxter.sh` (i will from now on assume that `catkin_ws` is the name of the workspace)with a text editor and modify the following line by inserting the Ip address of current machine of:

    your_ip="130.251.13.108"

## Steps to launch the simulation
Execute the script to initialize the simulation

     cd ~/catkin_ws
    ./baxter.sh localhost
    roslaunch baxter_control_sofar baxter_world.launch 

Start the simulation: this launch file will spawn the baxter robot in a Gazebo simulation, together with all the services necessary. In addition, it will spawn a SDF model of a can of coke (the gravity and collision are disabled on this model). The can will act as a placeholder to better visualize the Baxter's left end effector position goal.

## Testing
Is possible to launch all the nodes separately to test if each one is working properly:
- Using launch files, start baxter simulation, when it has spawned correctly launch the second launch file in a new terminal window: (this will include all the steps below)

        roslaunch baxter_control_sofar baxter_world_test.launch
        roslaunch baxter_control_sofar spawn.launch 

- start each node separately

    start baxter simulation

        cd ~/catkin_ws
        roslaunch baxter_control_sofar baxter_world.launch

    spawn coke model

        rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file /home/rick/.gazebo/models/coke_can2/model.sdf -sdf -x 0.5 -y 0.5 -z 1 -model coke_can2

    start inverse kinematic script

        rosrun baxter_control_sofar ik_service_client2_topic.py -l left
    
    start the script to move the model of the coke can

        rosrun baxter_control_sofar move_coke_topic.py




## Interact with the simulation

### Coke model
move coke model by publishing on the gazebo topic:

    rostopic pub /gazebo/set_model_state gazebo_msgs/ModelState "model_name: 'coke_can2'
    pose:
    position:
        x: 0.5
        y: 0.5
        z: 0.5" 

in alternative open a new bash script and run this command:

    rosrun baxter_control_sofar move_coke_topic.py

publish point on the topic  `/coke_can_coords`

    rostopic pub /coke_can_cods geometry_msgs/Point "x: 0.5
    y: 0.4
    z: 0.8" 


### send a goal to the end effector

    rostopic pub position_sub geometry_msgs/Point "x: 0.5
    y: 0.4
    z: -0.1" 

## Generated topic and nodes
<img src="pictures/rosgraph.png" width="800">
Most of the topics and nodes shown in the image are the ones generated by the Baxter's simulation and the control SDK.
Here follow the description of the implemented nodes:
    
  - `move_coke_can`: the node will subcribe to `/coke_can_coords` and republish the coordinate, in addition to other informations, to `/gazebo/set_model_state`. This will communicate to the Gazebo simulation that the model "coke_can2" has to change position.
  - `ee_position_control`: the node will subscribe to the topic `/position_sub`, which will contain the goal position of the left end-effector of Baxster. The node will then call Baxter's `/PositionKinematicsNode/IKService` that will return the left arm's joint position to achieve the EE positioning. The message containing the joint's position will then be published in `/robot/limb/left/joint_command`. If the goal cannot be achieived (a robot's joint could be in a singularity), the robot will move in a joint position without singularities and will try again to reach the goal, if still it cannot be reached a "FAILED" message will be printed on the terminal.
  - `move_coke_can`: this node will subsribe to the topic `coke_can_coords` (a Point message) and it will republish to the Gazebo service `/gazebo/set_model_state` as a ModelState, to change the coke model's position in Gazebo.
